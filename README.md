# QR Code Authenticator

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on detecting counterfeit QR codes by distinguishing between:

- **First Prints** (Original QR Codes)
- **Second Prints** (Counterfeit QR Codes)

Using **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** and **Deep Learning (CNN)**, the system accurately classifies QR codes based on copy detection patterns (CDPs). The dataset consists of images of first prints (originals) and second prints (scanned & reprinted copies).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains:

- **First Print**: Original QR codes with embedded copy detection patterns.
- **Second Print**: Counterfeit versions created by scanning and reprinting the original QR codes.
